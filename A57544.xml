            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To heare of a true Convert is both <hi>Good</hi> newes and <hi>Great:</hi> A greater work it is to Convert, then to Create, ſhould we put into the one hand of God the World created, and into his other hand a ſoule converted; the glory of this hand would be the greater. If at our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>David</hi> falls a wondering, <hi>Surely I am fearefully and wonderfully made,</hi> much more ſhould we admire the work of our ſpirituall Regeneration and Converſion.</p>
            <p>Every Penitent may juſtly be brought in with a ſhoute; this by an eminence; whoſe Change in the order and diſpoſition of her life,<note place="margin">Luke 15.</note> was farre more ſtrange then the Returne of that Prodigall in the Parable, who yet went very farre, as there we reade.</p>
            <p>He was urged and driven thereto with the ſtormes of affliction and diſtreſſe; Need, Impatient hunger, and a baſe ſervice did beate him back; But this Woman en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the morrow as to day, and every day ſolemnizing (as it were) the Coronation of her ſinfull pleaſures, in the height of glory, when ſhe might have vied with the Summer-beames in pride and gliſtering: Then (like the King of <hi>Nineveh</hi>) to ariſe from this her throne,<note place="margin">Jonah 3.</note> and lay aſide thoſe roabes of her delights, and to cover her ſelfe in a wave of ſalt and bitter teares (as with ſackcloth.) And (ſitting downe in the aſhes of her ſorrow) to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime a perpetuall Faſt from ſin; why, this (in mortall eyes) if ever any thing were ſtrange, was even ſtrangely wonderfull and full of admiration.</p>
            <p>Should we but caſt our eyes on each Particular Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the Text, we ſhould find them worthy our beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
            <p>Firſt, ſhe was a <hi>woman</hi> by Sex, and ſo the weaker veſſell, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.</p>
            <p>Secondly, a woman <hi>in the City</hi> (whether <hi>Naim</hi> or <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> it much matters not) a place uſually ſupplied with more variety of temptations then ordinarily the ſolitary and ſtill Countrey; and might be rubbs in her way and hinderances to her Converſion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, a woman in the City <hi>that was a Sinner,</hi> one infamouſly diſſolute, and obdured in a notorious trade of evill. Now that ſuch an one, ſhould preſume to come to a <hi>Phariſees</hi> houſe, a place of an awfull and ſevere pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and at ſuch a Time, when there was a <hi>Feaſt</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at <hi>Chriſt</hi> was preſent, who was purity it ſelfe. And after ſuch a manner, in a kind (as it may ſeeme) of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate unmannerlineſſe (unwontedly incident to a womans condition) to thruſt in, and then lay hold upon her Saviour; why theſe, every one ſeverally were pregnant Circumſtances of a moſt extraordinary repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of a rare <hi>Faith</hi> in ſo young a Convert.</p>
            <p>Nor do the other Circumſtances of her <hi>Repentance,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve any leſſe accent of admiration; be having found her <hi>Ieſus,</hi> ſhewes the true remorſe of her heart in ſix par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in her <hi>Humility;</hi> ſhe takes her ſtand at the feet of Chriſt, eſteeming the loweſt place too good for her, ſo vile an abject.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Baſhfullneſſe</hi> and ſhame; ſhe doth not boldly face Chriſt, but gets behind him; being conſcious of her ſins, which thus placed her deſervedly.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Sorrow;</hi> The Rock is now turned into a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-poole, and the flint into a river of waters: ſhe weepes, and in ſuch abundance, as that ſhe waſheth Chriſts feet with thoſe ſtreames of Penitence.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Revenge;</hi> That haire which ſhee had ſo
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:37808:13"/>often gently combed, and cunningly broydered againſt the glaſſe, and then ſpread forth as a net to catch her amorous Companions withall, ſhe now imployes in the wiping thoſe Feet, which ſhe had with her teares waſhed.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Love;</hi> manifeſted in kiſſing Chriſts Feet, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging thereby that ſhe taſted of the Comfort that was in him. O how gladly will one that hath eſcaped drowning kiſſe the ſhoare!</p>
            <p>Sixtly, <hi>Bounty;</hi> ſhe powres a pretious and coſtly oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon thoſe Feet ſhe had thus waſh't, and kiſſed: Every way ſhe approved her ſelfe <hi>a perfect Penitent</hi> And therefore no marvell (the great prize comming) if the Trumpets ſound; the newes of this rare Convert is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed with an <hi>Ecce, Behold a woman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this did <hi>Simon</hi> the Maſter of the Feaſt behold, but yet a ſquint; none ſtood ſo much upon the termes of their owne righteouſneſſe, as the <hi>Phariſees;</hi> nor did any more ſcornefully diſdaine the company of a perſon infamous, then did they. This <hi>Phariſee</hi> (though of the better ſort, as we may conceit in that he invited ſuch a gueſt as Jeſus) did ſtrongly ſavour of the leaven of his Profeſſion; for where he ſhould have admired Chriſts Mercy, he queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons his Calling; Before this he judged him a <hi>Prophet;</hi> now he queſtions whether he were ſo much: <hi>were this man a Prophet he would ſurely know what manner of Woman this is that toucheth him, for ſhe is a ſinner, q. d.</hi> I thought I had invited a Prophet to my houſe, but I ſee he is none. He is no Prophet who is ignorant of the life of one ſo vitious comming ſo neare him as to touch him. But of the vitious life of this woman who toucheth him and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth his feet he is altogether ignorant: It cannot be therefore that he is what I took him to be. The <hi>Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> he takes for granted, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 14.6. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 1.3. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.26, which yet is not true; for every Prophet, knew not every thing, no nor did the beſt Prophet ever know all things; their knowledge reacheth onely ſo farre as it ſhall pleaſe God to extend it, See 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.27. &amp;c. 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 3, 4.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:37808:13"/>
            <p>The <hi>Aſſumption</hi> he thus makes good, did he know how vitious a woman this is, he would not ſuffer her to come behind him and waſh his feete, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But this he ſuffers willingly, therefore he (queſtionleſſe) is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant what ſhe is.</p>
            <p>Our Bleſſed Saviour well perceiving <hi>Simons</hi> error to ariſe out of <hi>Ignorance</hi> or weake <hi>miſtaking,</hi> and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from a malicious ſpirit (as did other Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by ſome of his fellow <hi>Phariſees</hi>) Returnes a <hi>Convictive Anſwer</hi> by way of <hi>Parable,</hi> telling him of a <hi>certaine Creditor which had two debtors:</hi> wherein he doth firſt vindicate himſelfe, and make it evident to <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> that he knew both this womans <hi>life</hi> and <hi>heart,</hi> and ſo was a <hi>Prophet,</hi> yea and more then ſo. Secondly, defends this woman, proving that ſhe was not now what ſhe had beene, nor as he conceived her to be. For ſhe was changed from what ſhe was, and therefore not to be cenſured for that ſhe is not.</p>

            <p>The <hi>Occaſion</hi> was, the <hi>Objection</hi> that <hi>Simon</hi> made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in himſelfe, upon the ground you heard before; His Heart made the <hi>Queſtion,</hi> and Chriſt makes <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it.</p>

               <p>A Calling that hath beene honoured not only of the meaner ſort, but even of the honourable themſelves. <hi>Obadiah</hi> a great Courtier, calls <hi>Elijah Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.7. <hi>Naaman</hi> the only Favourite of the King of <hi>Aram,</hi> ſtiles himſelfe <hi>Eliſhaes Servant,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.18. <hi>Ioaſh</hi> and <hi>Ioram</hi> ſtile him Father, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Nebuchaduezzar</hi> the

               <p>If you would know the Reaſons, why you ſhould ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and reſpect them, I will acquaint you with ſome briefly.

They are the <hi>Stewards</hi> of his houſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. <hi>Secretaries</hi> of State, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.7. His <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadours,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10.

And ſhall not theſe ſervants, which are in ſuch high places under the <hi>God of heaven</hi> (whoſe ſervice Kings themſelves may not ſcorne) have reſepect? Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, honour is due unto them in regard of their Gifts; it is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:37808:25"/>a barbarous thing not to honour learning; and above all gifts and learning the beſt gifts ſhould be honoured moſt, of which ſort theirs are, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.31. <hi>&amp;</hi> 14.1, 5.

                  </gap>, greater then the greateſt.</p>
               <p>The Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> ſaid of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist, he ſhall be great in the ſight of the Lord, Luke</hi> 1.15. And yet his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is not ſo great, as theirs is, under the Goſpell; <hi>A grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then he,</hi> (our aviour ſaith) <hi>was not borne of a woman;</hi> that is, amongſt thoſe ancient Prophets which have been moſt famous in the world in former times, none greater then <hi>Iohn; yet he that is least in the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is greater then he:</hi> that is, the meaneſt Miniſter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpell hath a more excellent office and function then he had. They preaching the ſame Saviour which he did; and that not onely <hi>exhibited</hi> (wherein <hi>Iohn</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled the Prophets before him) but as having <hi>fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied</hi> for mankind, <hi>triumphed</hi> over <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>Hell,</hi> and <hi>aſcended</hi> into the glory of his Father. Yea ſo great is this Calling of theirs, that the Sonne of God himſelfe did not diſdaine to live in it, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. <hi>The latchet of whoſe ſhooes</hi> John Baptiſt <hi>thought himſelfe unworthy to ſtoope downe and unlooſe, Mark.</hi> 1.7.</p>
               <p>The meane and baſe opinion that the world hath of Prophets, is through the ſubtilty, and deceit of Satan, who well knoweth, that the Doctrine ſhall little or nothing be eſteemed of, where the Perſon is not reverenced, and regarded. This was the cauſe why our bleſſed Saviour
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:37808:26"/>himſelfe, would ſtay no longer in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> (though it was the Towne where he was brought up,<note place="margin">Luk. 2.39.4.16.</note> and where his Parents formerly had dwelt) but went into other parts of <hi>Galile;</hi> For that <hi>a Prophet hath no honour in his owne Countrey, Ioh.</hi> 4.14. Why ſtood he ſo much upon his honour? He told us that he ſeekes not his owne praiſe, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.48, 49. Nor did he, but yet he knew full well that none could receive benefit by his Miniſtery, who did not reverence his Perſon. And thence it was he ſtood ſo much upon his honour, as that he would preach no where but where he might be honoured.</p>
               <p>The contempt that is done to them, reacheth to the holy things that they are employed in; yea it reacheth to God himſelfe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.16. whence it is that God hath taken it ſo heinouſly, and puniſhed the contempt of his Meſſengers ſo ſeverely as we read, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 3.16. 2 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13. <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.43. <hi>&amp;</hi> 23.39.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herod</hi> (you know) pretended great love to <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> yet to pleaſure a minſing Damſell, he cut off his head, and gave it her for a favour. Did God take this well? When Chriſt was before him, he would not anſwer him a word, which ſhewes he was not well plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with him: He ſpake to the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> ſome words, though not many; to <hi>Pilate</hi> ſome; but when he came before <hi>Herod,</hi> never a word at all, (and no wonder, <hi>Iohn</hi> was <hi>vox clamantis,</hi> the voice of Chriſt, and <hi>Herod</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heading <hi>Iohn</hi> had taken away Chriſts voice before) Be aſſured Chriſt will do the more when he is ſilent.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> Think us not proud whilſt we preſſe this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine on you. Humility you ſay becomes us; We would be <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> over Gods heritage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> In preaching this Truth, we preach not our ſelves but Chriſt Jeſus, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.5.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In preſſing this, we pleade not for <hi>Phariſaicall</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heminence, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.6. nor do we challenge to our ſelves that Civill Authority and reverence that is due to Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, and great men of the world; but that which

               <p>Or ſay they ſometimes lend an Eare to what is good, yet they come not with an <hi>open heart,</hi> ready to heare whatſoever Chriſt ſhall ſay, and to receive it whoever be the bringer. (Like a bad Porter,) the eare admits of none that comes not in <hi>gay cloathing;</hi> plaine ſtuffe (as the doctrine of Faith, good works, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) is thruſt back: It may be the <hi>word of Doctrine</hi> they will attend unto, but not the <hi>word of Application;</hi> the <hi>word of Exhortation,</hi> but not the <hi>word of Reprehenſion.

               <p>Secondly, ſome <hi>Heare,</hi> but they <hi>underſtand</hi> not what they heare, like thoſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.22. they marvelled, and left him and went their way. Or with thoſe who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied S. <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9.7. they heard a noiſe but knew not what it meant.

               <p>Let not theſe forget what they read, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.15. A more fearefull ſentence cannot be uttered in this life

Such Hearers had <hi>Ezekiel, Chap.</hi> 33.31. <hi>They heare thy words but they will not doe them,</hi> they are reſolved before hand what they will doe and not doe. So <hi>Ier.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Wee have piped to you</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>and yee have not danced, Mat.</hi> 11.17. Theſe kind of Hearers mind the Miniſters pipe, they have no care of their own feet to practiſe what they have heard.</p>
               <p>O that once GOD would be pleaſed to make us good <hi>Simons;</hi> that in hearing what CHRIST hath to ſay unto us, we would come as <hi>Cornelius</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.33. and with thoſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>verſe</hi> 41. <hi>gladly receive the Word</hi> whoever brings it. This is made a note of a true ſubject of Chriſt, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 32.3. Provided there be <hi>Caeſars</hi> ſtamp and armes upon the Coine, and that it come out of his Mint, and will abide the Touch-ſtone; if ſo, let it paſſe for currant with us.</p>
               <p>Old <hi>Eli</hi> was deſirous to be acquainted with every part of Gods bleſſed Will; he had great cauſe to feare, that what <hi>Samuell</hi> was to deliver to him, would make little for his comfort, yet ſee how he doth adjure young <hi>Samuell</hi> to tell him all, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3.17. Such ſhould be the deſire of all Gods people, that Gods Miniſters would deale faithfully with them in delivering the whole Counſell of God unto them; as well one part as another. Wantons you know come into a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:37808:28"/>to pick onely flowers; here they pick a gay, and there another; but the good houſwife comes to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther herbes; ſo ſhould we come into Gods Houſe to heare his Word.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point; Remember every Hebrew ſervant, who liked well his Maſters ſervice was to have his eare boared with an Aule againſt the doore, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.6. If you deſire to be in the liſts of Gods ſervants,<note place="margin">Via Domini ad cor dirigitur quum veritatis Sermo humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter auditur. Greg. Hom. <hi>10.</hi> Sup Ezek.</note> you muſt have a <hi>Boared eare;</hi> Indeed the Eare is the doore by which Chriſt takes poſſeſſion of the ſoule, and where he takes poſſeſſion it muſt be faire. See <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14, 17. The firſt linke of the golden Chaine is faſtned to the <hi>Eare; Faith comes by Hearing:</hi> upon the ring of the doore he layeth his bleſſed hand, and cryes, <hi>Open to mee my Siſter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 5.2.</note>

               <p>The Divells ſtudie is to keep this doore ſhut, that Chriſt may not enter: Like a <hi>Iaylour</hi> he will ſometimes be content to let his Priſoner have hands and feet free; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the priſon doores and gates be faſt lockt and barr'd: his Captives ſhall ſometimes give an almes, or doe ſome other outward work of mercy; come to Church to ſatisfie the Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But he cannot endure the doores ſhould ſtand open for feare of an eſcape. So <hi>Acts</hi> 7.57. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.45. Search the Scriptures and you ſhall find that none was cured with greater difficultie, then he that had a deafe and dumbe ſpirit.

               <p>The <hi>Debt</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſſe</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> is truly and <hi>properly</hi> called a <hi>Debt,</hi> being a payment of what before we have received.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Debt</hi> of <hi>Puniſhment</hi> is ſo called <hi>figuratively</hi> and <hi>improperly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, for that it doth ariſe after the manner of a Debt, upon the <hi>non-payment</hi> of what is due, and <hi>breach of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants;</hi> ſo becauſe we have not rendered to the Lord that which is his due; and which we in the Covenant of works <hi>(Doe this and Live)</hi> have covenanted with him for, we are his Debters.</p>

               <p>Secondly, other debts make us liable but to a <hi>bodily</hi> arreſt onely, the <hi>Conſcience</hi> may be free; but the debt of ſin doth endanger both <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soule</hi> too: All that a man hath is to be ſold, not our <hi>Goods</hi> onely, but our <hi>Two Sonnes,</hi> Body and ſoule muſt goe to pay the Creditor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p>Thirdly, other <hi>debts</hi> may be <hi>forgotten,</hi> and ſo not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; but the debt of ſin cannot be forgotten of the Lord, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.7. he keepeth a <hi>Debt-booke</hi> wherein all is written, with the <hi>day</hi> and <hi>place.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.6. <hi>Caines</hi> debt is as freſh in Gods mind, as if it were but yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</p>

The hornes of the Altar cannot protect us, 1 <hi>King</hi> 2.28.31. Nor can Mountaines and Rocks conceale us <hi>Revel</hi> 6.16.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, there may be a <hi>flying away</hi> from other Debtors, and a hiding our ſelves from mans Attachments; but <hi>flying</hi> here will not ſave us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7. <hi>Whether ſhall I fly from thy preſence?</hi>

               <p>Seventhly, thou maiſt have a friend which may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take for other debts when thou art in Priſon, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound for part, or uſe ſome other meanes for liberty; but being caſt into this priſon there is no ſuch hope; amongſt the Celeſtiall company thou canſt not find one comforter; not one amongſt your ſelves can help ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

               <p>Laſtly, if thou art not freed out of the hands of other Creditors, by friends or other meanes, yet <hi>death</hi> will <hi>free thee.</hi> But it is not ſo here, the debt which ſin caſts thee into is moſt called for, and moſt terrible after death: aſſoone as thy ſoule departs from thy body, it goes to the Priſon of Hell, and within a while, both Body and Soule muſt be arraigned at Gods dreadfull barre, whoſe Juſtice will be ſo exact, and infinite, that every particular ſin with the aggravations thereof ſhall be put into the Plea, and prooved againſt thee: upon which a Sentence ſhall paſſe, and the execution of fearfull damnation both of Body and Soule ſhall be ſerved on thee. Thus you ſee, of all debt the debt of ſin is the worſt, and amongſt all debtors none like to ſinners.</p>
               <p>What madneſſe is it to ſeeme to be ſo much troubled with other debts, and yet this never thought on, or not to purpoſe? To an honeſt mind it is a <hi>Griefe</hi> and <hi>Shame,</hi> to owe more then they can pay; little honeſty have men, no more to regard this debt owing to the Almighty.

               <p>I deny not, but debts owing are to be required: God himſelf hath given liberty to the Creditor to take a pledge for his ſecurity, <hi>Deut.</hi> 24.10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p>I (likewiſe) grant that more ſtrictneſſe and extremity may be uſed in requiring a Debt of ſuch as raſhly caſt themſelves into it (though they be poore or pretend Inability, when indeed it is but a pretence,) (as the manner of many in theſe daies is,) <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.26. <hi>&amp;</hi> 27.13.</p>
               <p>But in the behalfe of the poore and needy; the well minded Debter, the Lord giveth an other charge, <hi>Exod.</hi> 22.26. <hi>If thou ſhalt receive to pawne the garment of thy Neighbour, restore it unto him before the Sunne goeth downe; for that onely is his covering, that is his garment for his skin, wherin ſhall he ſleep?

               </p>
               <p>Yet no debt whatever may be axacted without <hi>Mercy,</hi> ſtill remember, as man in a Debter <hi>unto thee,</hi> ſo art thou unto <hi>Mercy:</hi> Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> (<hi>Rom.</hi> 15.27.) ſheweth the <hi>Macedonians</hi> and <hi>Achaians</hi> were.

               <p>Myſtically, this ſets forth Gods mercifull and gratious diſpoſition towards poore ſinners, and ſerves firſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme us of this truth.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Sacrifices under the Law</hi> prefigured as much,

                  <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1. and the <hi>gratious promiſe under the Goſpell</hi> make it good, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18. <hi>&amp;</hi> 55.7. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.16. <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.31.

               <p>The grounds are two; Firſt, <hi>Mercy in God,</hi> who <hi>deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not the death of a ſinner, Ezek.</hi> 33.11. It is his Name to be <hi>mercifull:</hi> an <hi>Attribute</hi> as infinite as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, it ſuits with his <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Merit in Chriſt:</hi> By his Sacrifice he ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gods Juſtice, and paid the debt of ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 1.14. 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9 26.</p>
               <p>Hence commeth that ſweet concurrence of <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Iuſtice</hi> ſpoken of by the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.10. <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Truth are met together, Righteouſneſſe and Peace have kiſſed each other.</hi> They met together and that divers times, but did never kiſſe till Chriſt reconciled them; when they met before, they met in a kind of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſheweth in Dialogue) A great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention there was betwixt them about mans Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">Ser. <hi>1.</hi> de An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nun Dom.</note> 
                  <hi>Mercy</hi> pleads hard, What hath <hi>God forgotten to be gratious, will hee caſt us of for ever and be no more intreated?</hi> That by no meanes wils the death of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; <hi>Iuſtice</hi> ſteps in, and requires that ſhe may have her due, and that <hi>the ſoule that ſinnes may die;</hi> Haſt not thou ſaid it, and ſhall <hi>not the Iudge of all the earth do right?</hi> Thus the Plea hangs; our ſalvation lies as it were a blee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, we as guilty priſoners ſtill ſtand at the Barre. Chriſt ſteps in, gives Juſtice ſatisfaction, ends the quarrell, and makes all kind, kiſſing friends. For in giving himſelfe a ranſome for man, he did at once pay both <hi>Iustice</hi> her debt, and obtaine for <hi>Mercy</hi> her deſire.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Vſe. </seg>
                  </label> Great is the comfort that poore ſinners may have from hence; to looke upon the greatneſſe of our debt, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſſe of the ſum is enough to ſinke us; but to heare
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:37808:44"/>of a poſſibility to procure a diſcharge, to put a new life and ſpirit into us as it did into the hearts of the people, when they heard <hi>Shecaniah</hi> tell them that there was <hi>hope in Iſrael concerning this thing, Ezra,</hi> 10 2.</p>
               <p>It may alſo encourage us to uſe ſpeedie meanes for the obtaining of a <hi>Pardon;</hi> ſeeing in ſeeking after it, we ſeeke after that which is honourable and worth the having.</p>
               <p>A mercy of all mercies it is to have our ſins forgiven; there needs no more but that, to make us truly happy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7. Salvation ſtands in it, and under that one benefit, all the good that we receive by Chriſt is compriſed; It is put for the whole Covenant, and for all the priviledges therein contained, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. and is eſteemed the greateſt bleſſing which flowes from Chriſts blood, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. That is the <hi>Fountaine</hi> (as it were,) other bleſſings are but <hi>ſtreames</hi> iſſuing thence; the things of this world are made true bleſſings by it.</p>
               <p>And yet how unworthily is this put in the laſt place in moſt mens endeavours? Should a man ſtand with <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> in the window of his houſe, and looke and conſider the courſes of men, how ſhould we ſee them buſied? Some eagerly purſuing wealth, other greatneſſe, other following pride and vaine delights; like children they run after Butter-flies: But not one amongſt many who ſpends his time and ſtudie this way, how to get a pardon of ſin, and a diſcharge of that debt he owes to Gods divine Juſtice; <hi>Pray you to the Lord</hi> (ſaid <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> unto <hi>Moſes</hi>) <hi>that hee may take away the frogs from mee:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 8.8.</note> he deſired not that his ſins might be taken away, which were the cauſe of them; ſo is it with the men of this world, they pray to have ſickneſſe, poverty, lameneſſe <hi>&amp;c.</hi> removed from them, but for their ſins they paſſe not, that debt leaſt of all troubles them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quest.</hi> But whence is it that men are ſo careleſſe in ſeeking after this one thing neceſſary?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Diverſe Reaſons may be rendered of this great neglect.</p>

                  </label> Firſt, an <hi>erroneous judgement</hi> about the thing it ſelfe: Some think it is that which cannot be had, or if it be feiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yet it is not ſo neceſſary as other bleſſings, which lies them more in hand to ſeeke after. The errour of which opinions what hath beene ſaid before, diſcovers.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this great neglect ariſeth from <hi>want of due conſideration</hi> of mens preſent ſtates, they ſpend no thoughts this way; like Banquerouts, they love not to caſt up their accounts. Men are not aware how many Bills of particular ſins hang upon the file, and are upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord againſt them in the Lords Court of Juſtice; they conſider not how they lie open (till diſcharge be had) to all Gods plagues and curſes, which dog and follow them at the heeles in every corner like ſo many Serjants to arreſt them at Gods Suit, <hi>Deut</hi> 28.19. They conſider not that after death there is no Redemption: If a diſcharge be not obtained before death, lay hold upon them, there is no way but one, to priſon with them. And how Hell follow s death at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>as the fiſhes that are taken in an evill net,</hi> (even whilſt they are flating and playing at a flie,) <hi>and as the Birds that are caught in the ſnare, ſo are the ſonnes of men ſnared in an evill time, when it falleth ſuddenly on them</hi> (ſaith <hi>Salomon</hi>) Were theſe things well thought on, men would feare to let the temples of their heads take any reſt in the omiſſion of this duty.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, this ariſeth in ſome through a <hi>bold preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods mercy,</hi> conceiting that God will forgive us our ſins, though we take no paines about it. God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is mercifull, and his <hi>mercy is above all his workes;</hi> but ſtill it is reſtrained <hi>to thoſe that ſeeke it, Lament.</hi> 3.25. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. As for other who are brutiſh, and ſin preſumptuouſly on hope of mercy, God hath already acquainted them with his mind, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19, 20. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27.11. <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.27, 28, 29, 30.</p>
               <p>But if it be ſo great a bleſſing, and haveable likewiſe;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:37808:45"/>It may be you will aske me about the <hi>meanes</hi> that muſt be uſed for the obtaining of it. If ſo, I anſwer</p>
               <p>Firſt, bring thy ſoule to a true <hi>ſight and ſenſe of ſinne,</hi> this is that which prepareth a man, and maketh him capiable of a pardon. <hi>The whole have no need of the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, but the ſicke, Mat.</hi> 9.12. nor are any called to be eaſed, but ſuch as find themſelves to be wearied with the load, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11. <hi>verſe</hi> 28. The widow ſaid to the Prophet, <hi>O thou man of God why commeſt thou to call my ſinne to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and to ſlay my ſonne;</hi> but thus to bring ſin to our remembrance is not to <hi>ſlay us,</hi> but to <hi>ſave us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Iudge your ſelves</hi> for them, confeſſe them humbly before the Lord, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.18, 19. <hi>&amp;</hi> 18.13. 1 <hi>Iohn Chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſe</hi> 9. <hi>Pro.</hi> 28.13.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Pray earneſtly</hi> to the Lord in the Name of Chriſt for pardon and forgiveneſſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 14.3. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.18, 19. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.32.

               <p>Fourthly, carefully <hi>uſe the meanes</hi> which God hath left to his Church for the obtaining of this grace; attend on the Miniſters of the Word, it is the <hi>Ministery of Reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.

               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Lord doth ſo, (and much more) fully forgive the ſins of the Faithfull, as he would have them forgive one another; and he makes his forgiveneſſe the very patterne we ſhould work by, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4 32. But in our forgiving he requires that both the <hi>fault</hi> and <hi>puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> be forgiven, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.9.

               <p>I ſpare any further wading in this point; Thus much I thought needfull to ſay on it, for that this Popiſh opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Satisfaction</hi> cleaves (as one ſaith well) very cloſe unto our natures, and there is an aptneſſe in us to thinke by ſome act of ours to make amends for the things we have done amiſſe.

                  </label> This is a Doctrine of ſingular <hi>Comfort</hi> to all thoſe that are in Chriſt and made partakers of this benefit of Remiſſion. </p>
               <p>It is ſtoryed of <hi>Caeſar</hi> to his renowne and praiſe, that after the defeate of <hi>Pompey</hi> hee had in his cuſtody a Casket, wherein he found divers letters written by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Nobles under their own hands, (ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to condemn them) but he burnt them al, that no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument might remain of a future grudge. Thus doth God cancell and annihilate the ſins of his Elect ones; and cauſeth an act of Oblivion to be made, that there may be no quarrell againſt them in Heaven.</p>
               <p>And (to be ſhort) being thus fully pardoned, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever happens to us or is inflicted on us, wee may reſt aſſured comes in <hi>Love,</hi> it is mingled with <hi>Love,</hi> and ſhall through <hi>Love</hi> be turned to our good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. Let our Afflictions ſmart never ſo much, yet the curſe is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; they are but <hi>medicinable potions,</hi> and ſhall further our ſalvation in the end.</p>
               <p>

               <p>And (to conclude) be carefull that we lay up ſafe our diſcharge and pardon having once obtained it. How care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full men are to lock up a <hi>Generall diſcharge</hi> from ſome <hi>pecuniarie</hi> debts, we know well enough; but no diſcharge to this, ſo lay it up, that you may not have it to ſeek in the hower of <hi>Temptations</hi> and <hi>Tryall.</hi> Such times you muſt expect, and then your Acquittance ſealed with Chriſts blood will ſtand you in much ſtead. Our care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſſe this way, often cauſeth God to hide from us the comfort of it, to the end that wee may ſeeke it up, and keep it better. Thus we lay ſome peece of plate aſide for a while to teach a careleſſe child, or ſervant,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:37808:47"/>to be more carefull of it after it is returned. And thus much of the <hi>Fullneſſe</hi> of Gods pardoning. Come we now to the <hi>Freeneſſe</hi> of it. Hee <hi>Frankly forgave them both.</hi> Whence obſerve we</p>

               <p>There was a Gentleman of a Noble houſe, (his name was <hi>Androcles</hi>) being taken Priſoner, and made a ſlave to a Noble man of <hi>Rome;</hi> through hard and cruell dealing, ran away from him, and fled into certaine deſert woods, in <hi>Affrica;</hi> where he wandring up and downe, at laſt eſpied a Cave under the ground, which (unknowne to him) was the Den of a <hi>Lyon,</hi> into this he goeth to repoſe himſelfe that night; by and by comes in the <hi>Lyon</hi> roa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and halting, and eſpying <hi>Androcles,</hi> lay downe by him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> putting forth his paw, which was grievouſly woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a ſtub; making moane, as though he deſired help: The man (perceiving the <hi>Lyons</hi> meaning) began to pluck up his ſpirits, and lookes into the <hi>Lyons</hi> foot,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:37808:57"/>plucks out the ſtub, dreſſeth the wound, (which was much feſtered) and waſht it with his Urine. The next day the <hi>Lyon</hi> went out for his Prey, and ſoone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes with it in his mouth, which he layed downe at the feet of <hi>Androcles,</hi> (who had eaten nothing two or three daies before) And thus did the <hi>Lyon</hi> daily for the ſpace of three yeares. Afterwards this <hi>Androcles</hi> waxing wearie of his ſolitary life, ſtoale away in the abſence of the <hi>Lyon</hi> and hid himſelfe not farre from the place: The <hi>Lyon</hi> returning after his accuſtomed manner with meate for his gueſt dinner; and not finding him, made pitifull moane and lamentation: <hi>Androcles</hi> (when the <hi>Lyon</hi> as he conceived was laid to reſt) departs; and wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up and downe fell by chance into the hands of thoſe, whom his Maſter had ſent to looke him up; and (being brought againe by them unto his Maſter,) was clapt up in Priſon, and condemned to be devoured by wild Beaſts (which they uſed to take in the Deſart for that purpoſe.) It ſo happened that this <hi>Lyon</hi> was ſhortly after taken by Hunters, and ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> and appointed to be the <hi>Lyon,</hi> with which the condemned were to combate; The <hi>Lyon</hi> was brought into the place, certaine Priſoners were caſt in unto him, (which he cruelly rent in peeces,) at length this poore ſlave was caſt in alſo, to be devoured with the reſt; But as the <hi>Lyon</hi> ran towards him to teare him, he knew the man, and came fawning on him like a dog, licking his hands and feet: <hi>Androcles</hi> perceiving it to be the <hi>Lyon</hi> with whom he lived in the Cave, ſtroa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him gently on the Head and Back, (to the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Beholders.) <hi>Titus</hi> the <hi>Emperour</hi> being then preſent, demanded of the man the cauſe of this, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Emperour the whole buſineſſe. The <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> hereupon pardons <hi>Androcles</hi> and gave him the <hi>Lyon</hi> which waited on him whitherſoever he went; of whom the people uſually ſaid, <hi>Hic eſt Leo hoſpes hominis, Hic eſt homo medicus leonis.</hi>

                  <hi>Eagle</hi> which a Boy had nouriſhed and brought up very carefully, and cured him being ſick: This <hi>Eagle</hi> ſhewed many and ſtrange ſignes of love unto the Boy. inſomuch that the youth falling ſick, the <hi>Eagle</hi> would continually ſit by him, and when the Boy did ſleep, it would ſleepe; and when the Boy did wake that would wake; and if the Boy would not eate his meate neither would that eate: and afterward when the Boy died and was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed forth upon a hearſe, the <hi>Eagle</hi> followed, and when the body of the Boy was buryed in the fire, the <hi>Eagle</hi> likewiſe flew into the fire, and ſo conſumed her ſelfe.</p>

               <p>For firſt, <hi>this is that he doth require</hi> both in <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpell, Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Mat.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, <hi>this is that he doth deſerve,</hi> for hath not he placed in us that <hi>affection of Love?</hi> Is it not a ſtreame of that living Fountaine who is Love it ſelfe? 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.8. Now, <hi>he that plants a vineyard ſhould drinke of the wine thereof</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.7. And God who hath planted this affection in us, ſhould chiefly taſt of it himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Againe, <hi>God hath manifeſted his Love to us in giving his onely beloved Sonne for us, Iohn</hi> 3.16. He hath begun to us in the cup of Love, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.10. Is it not fit that we ſhould pledge him? It is an elegant Obſervation of S. <hi>Bernard</hi> upon the <hi>Canticles;</hi> of all the motions and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the ſoule, none is ſo reciprocall as <hi>Love.</hi> If God be <hi>Angry with us</hi> we may not be <hi>angry with him;</hi> If God <hi>Reproove us,</hi> we may not <hi>reproove him;</hi> If hee <hi>Iudge us,</hi> we may not <hi>judge him</hi> &amp;c. but in <hi>Love</hi> wee may, yea ought to reciprocate with God: he <hi>loving us,</hi> we ought to <hi>re-love him,</hi> and woe to us if we anſwer him not herein in ſome meaſure.</p>
               <p>Beſides, <hi>there is nothing in God but deſerves love; I will call upon God</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>who is worthy to be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, Pſal.</hi> 18.3. So may we ſay truly; <hi>I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be loved.</hi> There is nothing that
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:37808:61"/>makes one fit, or worthy to be loved but is to be found in God; as ſurpaſſing Excellencie, Majeſty, and glory, high Soveraignty, and ſupreame Authority, free Grace, and rich Mercy, <hi>&amp;c. Thou art all faire my Love, thou art all faire, there is no blemiſh in thee.</hi> As then the ſonnes of God <hi>ſeeing the daughters of men that they were faire made choice of them, Gen.</hi> 6.1. So beholding this beauty and faireneſſe that is in God, make wee choice of him.</p>
               <p>As it is <hi>juſt in reſpect of God</hi> that we ſhould love him; ſo it is <hi>very profitable for our ſelves:</hi> no love is loſt in ſo doing.</p>

               <p>Firſt, <hi>Enflamed</hi> or <hi>Burning Love will not be eaſily quenched; much water, many floods cannot doe it, Cant.</hi> 8.7. It is firme and invincible, ſo that neither force,

               <p>Thus <hi>Pauls</hi> Love was a ſtrong Love, and carryed him through all conditions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>&amp;</hi> 5.14. <hi>Acts</hi> 21.13. And ſo the Love of the <hi>Martyrs</hi> afore mentioned.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> being in baniſhment by the meanes of <hi>Eudoxia</hi> the Empreſſe, in a letter he wrote to <hi>Cyriacus</hi> a Biſhop, tells him of his reſolution before he was bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. <hi>I thought with my ſelfe</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>that if ſhee will baniſh mee, the earth is the Lords; if ſhee will ſaw mee aſunder, I remembred</hi> Iſaiah; <hi>If drowne me, I thought on</hi> Jonah; <hi>If ſtone mee,</hi> Steven <hi>came into my minde; If be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head mee, I thought on</hi> John <hi>the</hi> Baptiſt; <hi>If take away my goods, why naked came I into the world, and naked ſhall I returne.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cant. 8.6.</note> Thus <hi>Love</hi> well kindled and in the <hi>flame,</hi> like <hi>death</hi> devoures all theſe feares like ſtubble.</p>
               <p>It is otherwiſe with a <hi>new-kindled Love:</hi> That is willing to ſuffer for Chriſt; but yet in time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it hides the head, and dares not be ſeene. So <hi>Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> who being a Ruler of the Jewes came to <hi>Ieſus</hi> by night,<note place="margin">John 3.</note> as being loath to be diſcovered. And the Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples fled from Chriſt, and left him alone upon his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion. It ſtands more in <hi>deſiring</hi> and <hi>wiſhing</hi> then <hi>action: O that I were able,</hi> that I could undergoe this or that for Chriſt my Saviour, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is her language.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>Love enflamed is ſtill aſcending;</hi> It hath ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and affectionate longings after God and to enjoy him. The Paſſions of this Love are ſo great, as that it doth over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a man, and make him ſick againe, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.5. Thus was it with S. <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 1.23. And ſo with other of the Saints, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. But where <hi>Love is weake</hi> and in the <hi>ſparke</hi> only it is otherwiſe, indeed they willingly would enjoy God who truly love him; but ſtill they feare they are not yet prepared, and therfore cry with <hi>David, O ſpare a little,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 39.</note> 
                  <hi>ſtay a while;</hi> (not for that they love not God, but) for that they are not in that readineſſe which they doe
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37808:65"/>deſire to come to God; So the Bride puts of a while longer, not out of a diſlike of the Bridegroomes perſon, nor for want of true Love unto him, but becauſe this lace is not yet ſet on, nor that garment finiſhed.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Enflamed Love gives great light.</hi> It is like a fired Beacon on a hill, all the Countrey take notice of it. Such cannot forbeare but they muſt be ſpeaking in Gods praiſe, and admiring every thing that is in him. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.9. <hi>The tongue is the Pen of a ready writer.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 31.23.</note> It runs over with Gods praiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 34. Yea this Love will ſhine in all the <hi>actions</hi> of a mans life as well as <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, Mat.</hi> 5.16.

Such impriſon the Love of God in their <hi>hearts</hi> and <hi>mouthes,</hi> in their <hi>courſe</hi> and <hi>Calling</hi> too too much, which argues their Love to be (as <hi>Lot</hi> ſaid of <hi>Zoar</hi>) but <hi>a little one.</hi>

               <p>Our <hi>Affections</hi> are the <hi>Eves</hi> which the Divell makes uſe of to betray our ſoules.

               <p>It cannot otherwiſe be; for where ſinne is <hi>repented</hi> there it is <hi>mortified;</hi> now that cannot be without pain and crying; a <hi>tooth</hi> is not drawn vvithout a groane; a <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> cannot be cut off without a <hi>teare;</hi> a <hi>Woman</hi> is not delivered of the burthen which ſhe hath carried in her womb but nine Months without many <hi>Throes</hi> and <hi>Pains.</hi> And can it be expected that any one ſhould be delivered of a man, that <hi>old-man, the man of ſin,</hi> which hath lyen ſo long within him without <hi>ſorrow</hi> and <hi>teares.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> was a man of a ſtout ſpirit, yet I heare him crying out, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. <hi>O wretched man that I am who ſhall deliver me from this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Death!</hi> And yet theſe pains of his were but after paines.</p>
               <p>And as this <hi>Part</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> cannot be without <hi>tears</hi> and <hi>cryings,</hi> no more can that other <hi>of living unto God.</hi> Our Lawyers define life by <hi>weeping:</hi> If a child be heard to cry it is a lawfull proofe of his living. If he be dead we ſay he is <hi>Still-borne.</hi> Whilſt the Infant lyeth in the darke priſon of the Mothers wombe, it weepeth not, but as ſoone as ever it commeth out of the vvombe into the light, it knits the browes and wrings the eyes and cryes: Thus whilſt a man lives in an unregenerate eſtate he <hi>weepeth</hi> not for ſin, nor cryeth he to God for Grace, but as ſoone as the light ſhineth on him, he bewaileth his miſery and never thinketh that he hath filled his cup full inough of <hi>teares.</hi>

<pb n="167" facs="tcp:37808:96"/>if in the dreſſing of the wound no paine be felt, we conclude the fleſh is dead, but when the Patient begins to complaine of the paine and is ſenſible of the ſmart, then it is taken for a good ſigne that the cure is in a good forwardneſſe. So we find it was with S. <hi>Peters Auditors, Act.</hi> 2.37. They were ſo ſenſible of the prick that the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gave them at the heart, that they cried out, <hi>What ſhall wee doe?</hi> And thus you ſee that neither part of <hi>Repentance</hi> can be without pain: Therfore we conclude the Point, <hi>Who have repented truly have lamented unfeinedly.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>Extremity of Griefe</hi> may ſometimes ſo oppreſſe and overwhelme the heart, as that it can eaſe it ſelfe no more by <hi>Teares</hi> than <hi>Words.</hi> Thus, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.4.

So we do read of one that did <hi>mourne</hi> much for the loſſe of a <hi>Servant,</hi> when hearing of the loſſe of his <hi>Sonne</hi> whom he dearly loved, he was ſo ſtruck, as that he could neither <hi>Speake</hi> nor <hi>Weepe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a deepe or freſh wound in the body, there is not firſt that paine felt, nor ſo much blood ſeene, as is in a little cut of the finger, becauſe the part is aſtonied for the time; ſo is ſometimes with the ſoule. The wine Veſſell (you know) without vent runs not, though it be ready to burſt.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding this, he that can <hi>weep</hi> for other things and doth not at one time or other <hi>weepe</hi> for ſin (if God let him live any time in the world after his converſion) that man may conclude with himſelf that his eſtate is not good nor his Repentance ſound.</p>

               <p n="2">2. Whether it was one and the ſame annoynting or done at ſeverall times. Of both briefly.</p>
               <p>Some are of opinion that our Saviour was thrice an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted and that by three ſeverall women. Once here, of which annoynting this our <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> only ſpeaks per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by this ſinner at which was no murmuring.

               </p>
               <p>Others conceive that there were but two annoyntings and done by two ſeverall <hi>Maries,</hi> the one by this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who was called an <hi>Harlot,</hi> the other by <hi>Mary</hi> the ſiſter of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> who was never ſo called (ſay they) Thus <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> in his 81. <hi>Hom. in Mat.</hi> And <hi>Hierom</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.4.</p>
               <p>Others conceive that it was the ſame <hi>Mary</hi> who did

               <p>And of this Opinion is S. <hi>Auſtin de Conſ. Evang. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 70.</p>
               <p>So S. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> on this place, and <hi>Gregory</hi> in his <hi>Mor. Beda, Leo,</hi> and all the <hi>Schoolemen,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Alber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> and <hi>Aquinas</hi> are herein moſt confident.</p>
               <p>That which may reſolve this doubt in queſtion and confirme this Opinion (me thinkes) is that, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 11.2. Where the <hi>Act</hi> of annoynting Chriſt, and the name of her <hi>Perſon</hi> is mentioned,<note place="margin">This <hi>Mary</hi> was ever known by the name of <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>It was that</hi> Mary <hi>which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noynted the Lord with oyntment and wiped his Feet with her haires, whoſe Brother</hi> Lazarus <hi>was dead:</hi> There is mention of one annoynting, and <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.3. there is ſpeech of a ſecond annoynting, <hi>Then tooke</hi> Mary <hi>a pound of Oyntment of Spiknard very coſtly and annoyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Feet of</hi> Jeſus, <hi>and wiped his Feet with her haire.</hi> Nor is it enough to ſay as <hi>Taber</hi> doth that it is ſpoken by <hi>Anticipation:</hi> For in all <hi>S. Iohns</hi> Goſpell (as <hi>Roffenſis</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers) there is not one <hi>Anticipation,</hi> nothing related by the Tence of the time paſt, that was to be future, and at that time not finiſhed.</p>
               <p>As for thoſe ſeeming differences in the <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> about the laſt annoynting, they may thus be reconciled: Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in one place all the Diſciples are ſaid to murmur, and in S. <hi>Iohn Iudas</hi> alone is charged with it, that <hi>Iudas</hi> perſwaded them to it. And indeed they ſpake out of a care of the poore, but <hi>Iudas</hi> out of a theeviſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention: So <hi>S. Auguſtine de Conſ. Evang. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Cap.</hi> 77.</p>
               <p>And for the annoynting of his <hi>Feet</hi> in one place, and in another place it is ſaid his <hi>Head:</hi> theſe are reconciled (ſaith <hi>S. Auſtin</hi>) if we ſay ſhe <hi>annoynted</hi> both <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Feet,</hi> firſt, ſhe began at his <hi>feet</hi> and ſo breaking the box diffuſed the reſidue upon his head.</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:37808:112"/>
               <p>For the time in that one ſaith it was ſix daies before the <hi>Paſſeover,</hi> the other but two, let no man be troubled at this (ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) For St. <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaketh by way of <hi>Recapitulation,</hi> and having ſpoken of the <hi>Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over</hi> to come within two dayes doth not ſay <hi>(After theſe things</hi> Jeſus <hi>being in the houſe of</hi> Simon <hi>the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi>) but only makes relation of a thing already done, not ſetting down the time.</p>
               <p>To ſay no more of this confuſed and perplexed <hi>Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which hath in it more ſubtilty than uſe or profit, as <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſmus</hi> ſpeaks.</p>

               <p>That the <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of our <hi>Love</hi> to God may be had is cleare. S. <hi>Peter</hi> was undoubtedly aſſured of it (and that even in the time of the great dejectedneſſe of his ſpirit) els he would never have ſaid as he did,<note place="margin">Joh. 21.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee;</hi> So the faithfull in whoſe name the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaketh, 1 <hi>Iohn.</hi> 3.14. were undoubtedly aſſured that they loved the children of GOD, by which Love likewiſe they were aſſured that they were tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from Death to Life, for that none can truely love the <hi>Children</hi> of God, but they muſt love the Father alſo.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Resp.</hi> This Grace can the hardlieſt be counterfetted of any other Grace: There is ſcarce any thing els that we can inſtance in, ſaith one, but a <hi>Hypocrite</hi> may go cheeke by jowle with a good Chriſtian: He may do all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſervices,<note place="margin">D. <hi>Preſton</hi> his Treat. of <hi>Love</hi> p. 151. &amp; on <hi>Effectuall faith</hi> page 72.</note> he may abſtaine from ſinnes, a great change may be wrought in him, we know how farre the third ground went, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.

                  <hi>Love,</hi> that is a thing which no <hi>Hypocrite</hi> is able to reach unto.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though ſaving <hi>Graces</hi> have their <hi>Counterfets,</hi> yet a man may be aſſured by the Word that he hath this and other <hi>Graces</hi> in him in <hi>Sincerity</hi> ſo as that he cannot be deceived in them: For as God gave <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Mount a <hi>Patterne,</hi> according to which he would have all things made in the <hi>Tabernacle, Hebr.</hi> 8.5.

               <p>Sometimes it ſignifieth <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>protection in this world</hi> from <hi>bodily</hi> and outward dangers, as <hi>Exo.</hi> 14.1.3. But that is not the <hi>Salvation</hi> which our Saviour here ſpeaks of to <hi>Mary.</hi>

You know the <hi>Sea</hi> doth not alwayes rage and roare: No <hi>Conſcience</hi> makes ſo rough weather as at no time to admit a calme. And when a Sinner ſhall tell you all is well and quiet at home: If you give him the hearing let that be all.

Were it not an <hi>Orient Pearle,</hi> or a <hi>Diamond</hi> of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable worth he would not have it in his Crown: Yea the very blood of his Sonne he gave to purchaſe it: Now how precious that blood was Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſhews, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. In which reſpect it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>the Peace of God, Phil.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.15. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.16.</p>
               <p>And as God doth thus highly prize it ſo do all the Godly (who have in them the ſpirit of diſcerning:) How bitterly have they bewayled the want of it? What ſighes and groanes have they ſent up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for obtaining it? Pſal. 51.8. And having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it, they would not willingly take ten thouſand worlds for it.</p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:37808:157"/>
               <p>Yea the <hi>wicked</hi> themſelves ſet a high price on it,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.13.</note> when their conſciences are awakened: How have they wiſhed any other paine or torture ſo they might have peace, what would <hi>Caine</hi> have given for it, think you? What would <hi>Iudas?</hi> What <hi>Belſhazzar?</hi> When horrours, feares, terrors have ſeaſed on them, then Peace hath bin in requeſt with them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, from the unſpeakable <hi>Benefits</hi> that true Peace brings along with it: What is it that can make a man happy, but attends on Peace? It comprehends in the very name of it all <hi>Happineſſe,</hi> both of <hi>Estate</hi> and <hi>Diſpoſition.</hi> That Mountaine wheron Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended though it abounded with <hi>Palmes, Pines,</hi> and <hi>Mirtles,</hi> yet it carried onely the name of <hi>Olives</hi> (an ancient Emblem of Peace) So though many mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies belong unto a Chriſtian, yet all are comprized under this one little word which is ſpeld with a few letters, <hi>Peace;</hi> whence it was that the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed nothing but Peace unto their friends, underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding therby all proſperous ſucceſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.13. <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.5. <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.21, 26. <hi>Luke</hi> 24.36.<note place="margin">Phil. 4.7. Coloſ. 3.</note> 
                  <hi>This fils the heart</hi> with <hi>Patience, Ioy, Comfort</hi> in believing: It <hi>preſerves the Soule,</hi> as in a ſtrong Garriſon, ſo that a man is as quiet there, as <hi>Eliſha</hi> in <hi>Dothan,</hi> and guards the principall forts from being ſurprized, as the city of <hi>Damaſcus</hi> was guarded by the King, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.32. <hi>It paſſeth all underſtanding,</hi> ſurpaſſeth all commending. Therefore as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaking of the excellency of this grace, and not being able to ſet foorth the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe therof ſaith (ſo muſt I crave leave to ſpeak) <hi>Differamus omnes laudes pacis,</hi>

Some deale vvith their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> as they deale with a <hi>new ſute</hi> which at firſt vvearing they are afraid of ſoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, they looke where they ſit; they looke where they leane, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But when the gloſſe begins to fade and it begins to be a little old, they have little care vvhere they beſtow it: There are who are like ſome <hi>new married husband;</hi> for a while his <hi>Love</hi> may not be out of his ſight, in nothing croſſed; the wind may not blow on her, the Sunne muſt be ſhaded from her beauty, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But within a while this fond dotard grows weary of his choice: And if he be ſo kind, as to give good words and kind looks abroad, yet he can (for a need) chide his wife at home: Have you not known ſome upon the ſuddain turne <hi>zealous Profeſſours</hi> who have ſtrained <hi>at a Gnat,</hi> and ſhortly after <hi>ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a Camell?</hi> At the firſt ſcrupeld an honeſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent <hi>Ceremony,</hi> and yet ſoone after made no bones of <hi>Drunkenneſſe, Adultery,</hi> and the like?
